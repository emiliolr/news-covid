This project is a freshman Monroe Scholar and was funded by William & Mary.

# Data

To comply with [Twitter's content redistribution policy](https://developer.twitter.com/en/developer-terms/agreement-and-policy) (see the "Content Redistribution" heading), I have dehydrated my tweet data sets. This also means that the _.ipynb_ files will have difficulty running without some intervention. 

The tweet IDs are inlcuded in `data/tweet_ids`. The format for the standard data set used in this project is shownn below, with one example row.

ID | User | Source_Name | Tweet_Text | Date_Time
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | 
1234991970243604482 | @ABC | ABC News | BREAKING: Joe Biden will win the Virginia primary, ABC News projects based on analysis of the exit poll. | 2020-03-04 00:00:05
